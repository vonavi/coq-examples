<h1>Question</h1>
<p>I've been trying to understand what <tt class="docutils literal">Set</tt> is after encountering it
in Adam Chlipala's book in addition to <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39601502/what-exactly-is-a-set-in-coq">this great discussion in SO</a>.
His first example definition binary ops using <tt class="docutils literal">Set</tt>:</p>
<pre class="alectryon-io highlight"><!-- Generator: Alectryon --><span class="alectryon-sentence"><span class="alectryon-input"><span class="kn">Inductive</span> <span class="nf">binop</span> : <span class="kt">Set</span> := Plus | Times.</span></span></pre><p>in that book he says:</p>
<blockquote>
Second, there is the <tt class="docutils literal">: Set</tt> fragment, which declares that we
are defining a datatype that should be thought of as a constituent
of programs.</blockquote>
<p>Which confuses me. What does Adam mean here?</p>
<p>In addition, I thought that some additional concrete examples would
help my understanding. I am not an expert of Coq so I am not sure what
type of examples would help but something simple and very
concrete/grounded might be useful.</p>
<p>Note, I have seen that <tt class="docutils literal">Set</tt> is the first &quot;type set&quot; in a the type
hierarchy e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">Set = Type(0) &lt;= Type = Type(1) &lt;= Type(2) &lt;= ...</tt>.
I guess this sort of makes sense intuitively like I'd assume <tt class="docutils literal">nat \in
Type</tt> and all usual programming types to be in it but not sure what
would be in <tt class="docutils literal">Type</tt> that wouldn't be in <tt class="docutils literal">Set</tt>. Perhaps recursive
types? Not sure if that is the right example but I am trying to wrap
my head around what this concept means and it's conceptual (&amp;
practical) usefulness.</p>

<div class="section" id="answer">
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>Though <tt class="docutils literal">Set</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">Type</tt> are different in Coq, this is mostly due
to historical reasons. Nowadays, most developments do not rely on
<tt class="docutils literal">Set</tt> being different from <tt class="docutils literal">Type</tt>. In particular, Adam's comment
would also make sense if you replace <tt class="docutils literal">Set</tt> by <tt class="docutils literal">Type</tt> everywhere.
The main point is that, when you want to define a datatype that you
can compute with during execution (e.g. a number), you want to put it
in <tt class="docutils literal">Set</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">Type</tt> <em>rather than</em> <tt class="docutils literal">Prop</tt>. This is because things
that live in <tt class="docutils literal">Prop</tt> are erased when you extract programs from Coq,
so something defined in <tt class="docutils literal">Prop</tt> would end up not computing anything.</p>
<p>As for your second question: <tt class="docutils literal">Set</tt> is something that lives in
<tt class="docutils literal">Type</tt>, but not in <tt class="docutils literal">Set</tt>, as the following snippet shows.</p>

 <span class="s2">&quot;Type@{u}&quot;</span> (universe inconsistency: Cannot enforce u
&lt; u because u = u).</blockquote></div></div></small></span></pre><p>Note that I had to add the <tt class="docutils literal">Universe u</tt>. declaration to force the
two occurrences of <tt class="docutils literal">Type</tt> to be at the same level. Without this
declaration, Coq would silently put the two <tt class="docutils literal">Type</tt>'s at different
universe levels, and the command would be accepted. (This would not
mean that <tt class="docutils literal">Type</tt> would have the same behavior as <tt class="docutils literal">Set</tt> in this
example, since <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Type&#64;{u}</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Type&#64;{v}</span></tt> are different things when
<tt class="docutils literal">u</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">v</tt> are different!)</p>
<p>If you're wondering why this feature is useful, it is not by chance.
The overwhelming majority of Coq developments does not rely on it. It
is turned off by default because it is incompatible with a few axioms
that are generally considered more useful in Coq developments, such as
the strong law of the excluded middle:</p>
<pre class="alectryon-io highlight"><!-- Generator: Alectryon --><span class="alectryon-sentence"><span class="alectryon-input"><span class="kn">Axiom</span> <span class="nv">excluded_middle</span> : <span class="kr">forall</span> <span class="nv">A</span> : <span class="kt">Prop</span>, {A} + {~ A}.</span></span></pre><p>With <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-impredicative-set</span></tt> turned on, this axiom yields a paradox,
while it is safe to use by default.</p>
