<h2>Question</h2>
<p>When looking at results for types with decidable equality (especially
in <a class="reference external" href="https://coq.inria.fr/library/Coq.Logic.Eqdep_dec.html">Eqdep_dec</a>) there are
some of the results that (for a type <span class="docutils literal">A</span>) require</p>
<pre class="alectryon-io highlight"><!-- Generator: Alectryon --><span class="alectryon-sentence"><span class="alectryon-input"><span class="kn">Variable</span> <span class="nv">eq_dec</span> : <span class="kr">forall</span> <span class="nv">x</span> <span class="nv">y</span> : A, x = y \/ x &lt;&gt; y.</span><span class="alectryon-wsp">
</span></span></pre><p>whereas some require</p>
<pre class="alectryon-io highlight"><!-- Generator: Alectryon --><span class="alectryon-sentence"><span class="alectryon-input"><span class="kn">Axiom</span> <span class="nv">eq_dec</span> : <span class="kr">forall</span> <span class="nv">x</span> <span class="nv">y</span> : A, {x = y} + {x &lt;&gt; y}.</span><span class="alectryon-wsp">
</span></span></pre><p>It is my impression that it is the last one that is referred to as
<em>decidable equality</em>, but I am very much uncertain what the difference
is. I know that <span class="docutils literal">x = y \/ x &lt;&gt; y</span> in <span class="docutils literal">Prop</span> and <span class="docutils literal">{x = y} + {x &lt;&gt; y}</span> is in <span class="docutils literal">Set</span>, and I can prove the first one from the second one
but not the other way around. As far as I understand it, it is because
I am not allowed to construct values of type <span class="docutils literal">Prop</span> from values of
type <span class="docutils literal">Set</span>.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell what the difference between the two are? Are there
some example of a type for which the first statement can be proved but
not the second. Also, is it true that the version with <span class="docutils literal">{x = y} + {x &lt;&gt; y}</span> is what is referred to as decidable equality?</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>You are correct that the latter definition, the one which lives in
<span class="docutils literal">Set</span>, is referred to as <em>decidable equality</em>.</p>
<p>Intuitively, we interpret objects in <span class="docutils literal">Set</span> as programs, and objects
in <span class="docutils literal">Prop</span> as proofs. So the decidable equality type is the type of a
function which takes any two elements of some type <span class="docutils literal">A</span> and decides
whether they are equal or unequal.</p>
<p>The other statement is slightly weaker. It describes the proposition
that any two elements of <span class="docutils literal">A</span> are either equal of unequal. Notably,
we would not be able to inspect <em>which</em> outcome is the case for
specific values of <span class="docutils literal">x</span> and <span class="docutils literal">y</span>, at least outside of case analysis
within a proof. This is the result of the <span class="docutils literal">Prop</span> elimination
restriction that you alluded to (although you got it backwards: one is
not allowed to construct values of sort <span class="docutils literal">Set</span>/<span class="docutils literal">Type</span> by
eliminating/matching on an element of sort <span class="docutils literal">Prop</span>).</p>
<p>Without adding axioms, the <span class="docutils literal">Prop</span> universe is constructive, so I
believe that there would not be any types <span class="docutils literal">A</span> such that equality is
undecidable but the propositional variant is provable. However,
consider the scenario in which we make the <span class="docutils literal">Prop</span> universe classical
by adding the following axiom:</p>
<pre class="alectryon-io highlight"><!-- Generator: Alectryon --><span class="alectryon-sentence"><span class="alectryon-input"><span class="kn">Axiom</span> <span class="nv">classic</span> : <span class="kr">forall</span> <span class="nv">P</span>, P \/ ~P.</span></span></pre><p>This would make the propositional variant trivially provable for any
type <span class="docutils literal">A</span>, while the decidable equality may not be realizable.</p>
<p>Note that our axiom is a proposition. Intuitively, it makes sense that
either a proposition or its negation must hold. If we hadn't made this
a <span class="docutils literal">Prop</span> (for example, if we axiomatized <span class="docutils literal">forall P, {P} + {~P}</span>),
then we would likely not accept the axiom, since it would instead be
declaring the existence of a universal decision procedure.</p>
<p>That was a bit of a digression, but hopefully it demonstrated some
differences in our interpretation of <span class="docutils literal">Prop</span>s and <span class="docutils literal">Set</span>s.</p>
