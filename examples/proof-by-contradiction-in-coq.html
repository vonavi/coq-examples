<h1>Question</h1>
<p>I am trying to understand the apparent paradox of the logical
framework of theorem provers like Coq not including LEM yet also being
able to construct proofs by contradiction. Specifically the
intuitionistic type theory that these theorem provers are based on
does not allow for any logical construction of the form <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">￢(￢P)⇒P</span></tt>,
and so what is required in order to artificially construct this in a
language like Coq? And how is the constructive character of the system
preserved if this is allowed?</p>

<h1>Answer (Arthur Azevedo De Amorim)</h1>
<p>I think you are mixing up two related uses of contradiction in logic.
One is the technique of <em>proof by contradiction</em>, which says that you
can prove <tt class="docutils literal">P</tt> by proving <tt class="docutils literal">~ (~ P)</tt> -- that is, by showing that <tt class="docutils literal">~
P</tt> entails a contradiction. This technique is actually <em>not</em>
available in general in constructive logics like Coq, unless one of
the following applies.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>You add the excluded middle <tt class="docutils literal">forall P, P \/ ~ P</tt> as an axiom. Coq
supports this, but this addition means that you are not working in
a constructive logic anymore.</li>
<li>The proposition <tt class="docutils literal">P</tt> is known to be decidable (i.e., <tt class="docutils literal">P \/ ~ P</tt>
holds). This is the case, for example, for the equality of two
natural numbers <tt class="docutils literal">n</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">m</tt>, which we can prove by induction.</li>
<li>The proposition <tt class="docutils literal">P</tt> is of the form <tt class="docutils literal">~ Q</tt>. Since <tt class="docutils literal">Q <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> ~ (~
Q)</tt> holds constructively, by the law of contrapositives (which is
also valid constructively), we obtain <tt class="docutils literal">~ (~ (~ Q)) <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> (~ Q)</tt>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The other use of contradiction is the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion">principle of explosion</a>, which says
that anything follows once you assume a contradiction (i.e., <tt class="docutils literal">False</tt>
in Coq). Unlike proof by contradiction, the principle of explosion is
<em>always</em> valid in constructive logic, so there is no paradox here.</p>

<h1>Answer (L. Garde)</h1>
<p>In constructive logic, by definition, a contradiction is an inhabitant
of the empty type <tt class="docutils literal">0</tt>, and, also by definition, the negation <tt class="docutils literal">￢P</tt>
of a proposition <tt class="docutils literal">P</tt> is a function of type: <tt class="docutils literal">P <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> 0</tt> that gives an
inhabitant of the empty type <tt class="docutils literal">0</tt> from an inhabitant (a proof) of
<tt class="docutils literal">P</tt>.</p>
<p>If you assume an inhabitant (proof) of <tt class="docutils literal">P</tt>, and derive
constructively an inhabitant of <tt class="docutils literal">0</tt>, you have defined a function
inhabiting the type <tt class="docutils literal">P <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> 0</tt>, i.e. a proof of <tt class="docutils literal">￢P</tt>. This is a
constructive sort of proof by contradiction: assume <tt class="docutils literal">P</tt>, derive a
contradiction, conclude <tt class="docutils literal">￢P</tt>.</p>
<p>Now if you assume <tt class="docutils literal">￢P</tt> and derive a contradiction, you have a
constructive proof of <tt class="docutils literal">￢￢P</tt>, but cannot conclude constructively
that you have a proof of <tt class="docutils literal">P</tt>: for this you need the LEM axiom.</p>
