<h1>Question</h1>
<p>when constructing proof in coqide, I didn't find a way to step though</p>
<pre class="code coq literal-block">
<span class="n">T1</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="n">T2</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="n">T3</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="o">...;</span> <span class="n">Tn</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre>
<p>one tactic by one tactic. So it became very difficult to <strong>construct</strong>
correct proof like the code above. So my question is</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Is there a way to step through the code above or</li>
<li>How do you construct proof like the code above?</li>
</ul>
<p>Forward one Command or go to cursor aren't work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="answer">
<h1>Answer</h1>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">t1; t2</tt> is not the same as doing first <tt class="docutils literal">t1</tt> then <tt class="docutils literal">t2</tt>. If you
want to do this you can do <tt class="docutils literal">t1. t2.</tt> and this is the way to step
through them.</p>
<p>The semicolon serves three purposes, stated for <tt class="docutils literal">t1; t2</tt>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It applies <tt class="docutils literal">t2</tt> in all of the subgoals generated by <tt class="docutils literal">t1</tt>;</li>
<li>and it allows backtracking, if <tt class="docutils literal">t2</tt> were to fail, it would try a
different <em>success</em> for <tt class="docutils literal">t1</tt> and apply <tt class="docutils literal">t2</tt> again on the
generated subgoals;</li>
<li>third, it's the simplest way to write down a tactic that represents
a succession of tactics.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're lucky and this is the first or third case, then you can
modify the script by replacing</p>
<pre class="code coq literal-block">
<span class="n">t1</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="n">t2</span>
</pre>
<p>by</p>
<pre class="code coq literal-block">
<span class="n">t1</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="kp">all</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">t2</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre>
<p>using goal selectors. This way the first step will allow you to see
the goals generated by <tt class="docutils literal">t1</tt> and the second will show you how <tt class="docutils literal">t2</tt>
affects them. If you need more precision you can also focus one of the
subgoals to see <tt class="docutils literal">t2</tt> in action.</p>
<p>When backtracking is involved it becomes much harder to understand
what is going on, but I believe it can be avoided at first, or limited
to simple cases. You could for instance say that the goal can be
closed by applying an introduction rule (<tt class="docutils literal">constructor</tt>) and that
then it should be easy. If multiple intro-rules/constructors apply
doing</p>
<pre class="code coq literal-block">
<span class="nb">constructor</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="bp">easy</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre>
<p>might result in failure, while</p>
<pre class="code coq literal-block">
<span class="nb">constructor</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="bp">easy</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre>
<p>might succeed. Indeed, if <tt class="docutils literal">easy</tt> fails on the first constructor, coq
will try the second and so on.</p>
<p>To answer your question about how one would write them, I suppose it
can be the result of trial and error, and can mostly stem from
factorisation or automation of proof scripts. Say you have the
following proof script:</p>
<pre class="code coq literal-block">
<span class="nb">split</span><span class="o">.</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="nb">constructor</span><span class="o">.</span>
  <span class="o">+</span> <span class="bp">assumption</span><span class="o">.</span>
  <span class="o">+</span> <span class="bp">eassumption</span><span class="o">.</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="nb">constructor</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="bp">eassumption</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre>
<p>You might want to summarise it as follows:</p>
<pre class="code coq literal-block">
<span class="nb">split</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="nb">constructor</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="bp">eassumption</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre>
<p>I personally don't necessarily recommend it because it becomes harder
to maintain and harder to read for other users because of the issue of
not being able to step through. I would limit this to cases where the
proof is principled (like applying a constructor and be done with it),
and resort to goal selectors for factorisation.</p>
