<h2>Question</h2>
<p>I can't understand the difference between typeclasses and dependent
records in Coq. The reference manual gives the syntax of typeclasses,
but says nothing about what they really are and how should you use
them. A bit of thinking and searching reveals that typeclasses
essentially <em>are</em> dependent records with a bit of syntactic sugar that
allows Coq to automatically infer some implicit instances and
parameters. It seems that the algorithm for typeclasses works better
when there is more or a less only one possible instance of it in any
given context, but that's not a big issue since we can always move all
fields of typeclass to its parameters, removing ambiguity. Also the
<span class="docutils literal">Instance</span> declaration is automatically added to the Hints database
which can often ease the proofs but will also sometimes break them, if
the instances were too general and caused proof search loops or
explosions. Are there any other issues I should be aware of? What is
the heuristic for choosing between the two? E.g. would I lose anything
if I use only records and set their instances as implicit parameters
whenever possible?</p>

<section id="answer">
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>You are right: type classes in Coq are just records with special
plumbing and inference (there's also the special case of single-method
type classes, but it doesn't really affect this answer in any way).
Therefore, the only reason you would choose type classes over &quot;pure&quot;
dependent records is to benefit from the special inference that you
get with them: inference with plain dependent records is not very
powerful and doesn't allow you to omit much information.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the following code, which defines a monoid
type class, instantiating it with natural numbers:</p>
<pre class="alectryon-io highlight"><!-- Generator: Alectryon --><span class="alectryon-sentence"><span class="alectryon-input"><span class="kn">Class</span> <span class="nf">monoid</span> <span class="nv">A</span> :=
  Monoid {
      op : A -&gt; A -&gt; A;
      id : A;
      opA : <span class="kr">forall</span> <span class="nv">x</span> <span class="nv">y</span> <span class="nv">z</span>, op x (op y z) = op (op x y) z;
      idL : <span class="kr">forall</span> <span class="nv">x</span>, op id x = x;
      idR : <span class="kr">forall</span> <span class="nv">x</span>, op x id = x
    }.</span><span class="alectryon-wsp">
</span></span><span class="alectryon-wsp">
</span><span class="alectryon-sentence"><span class="alectryon-input"><span class="kn">Require Import</span> Arith.</span><span class="alectryon-wsp">
</span></span><span class="alectryon-wsp">
</span><span class="alectryon-sentence"><span class="alectryon-input"><span class="kn">Instance</span> <span class="nf">nat_plus_monoid</span> : monoid nat :=
  {|
    op := plus;
    id := <span class="mi">0</span>;
    opA := plus_assoc;
    idL := plus_O_n;
    idR := <span class="kr">fun</span> <span class="nv">n</span> =&gt; eq_sym (plus_n_O n)
  |}.</span></span></pre><p>Using type class inference, we can use any definitions that work for
any monoid directly with <span class="docutils literal">nat</span>, without supplying the type class
argument, e.g.</p>
<pre class="alectryon-io highlight"><!-- Generator: Alectryon --><span class="alectryon-sentence"><span class="alectryon-input"><span class="kn">Definition</span> <span class="nf">times_3</span> (<span class="nv">n</span> : nat) := op n (op n n).</span></span></pre><p>However, if you make the above definition into a regular record by
replacing <span class="docutils literal">Class</span> and <span class="docutils literal">Instance</span> by <span class="docutils literal">Record</span> and <span class="docutils literal">Definition</span>,
the same definition fails:</p>
<pre class="alectryon-io highlight"><!-- Generator: Alectryon --><span class="alectryon-sentence"><input checked="checked" class="alectryon-toggle" id="coq-typeclasses-vs-dependent-records-v-chk0" style="display: none" type="checkbox"><small class="alectryon-output"><div><div class="alectryon-messages"><blockquote class="alectryon-message">The command has indeed failed <span class="kr">with</span> message:
In environment
n : nat
The term <span class="s2">&quot;n&quot;</span> has type <span class="s2">&quot;nat&quot;</span>
while it <span class="kr">is</span> expected to <span class="nb">have</span> type <span class="s2">&quot;Type&quot;</span>.</blockquote></div></div></small></span></pre><p>The only caveat with type classes is that the instance inference
engine gets a bit lost sometimes, causing hard-to-understand error
messages to appear. That being said, it's not really a disadvantage
over dependent records, given that this possibility isn't even
available there.</p>
